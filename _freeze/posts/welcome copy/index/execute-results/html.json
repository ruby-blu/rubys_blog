Courses and faculty aim to simulate this in a classroom through various project and hands-on experiences. Despite some amazing in-class lessons learned and knowledge gained, I have found that the most valuable experiences I've had in the data science realm came from working as a student on campus.\n\n## Background\n\nAt the beginning of my very first semester here at BYU-Idaho, I was hired as a student office assistant in the Executive Office. At the time, the position was all about writing and editing, although I was exposed to some data manipulation and management. \n\nAs the years have progressed, however, I have been tasked with more and more data-related assignments and been given amazing opportunities to work closely with members of the university's data team. Now, my primary role in the office is anything and everything data-related, including donations to the university and student scholarships.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nWhile my coursework gave me a solid foundation in data science concepts, working in a real-world environment introduced challenges and insights I never encountered in a classroom. From handling messy, real-world data to communicating insights with non-technical decision-makers, my student employment has given me a clearer picture of what it truly means to work in data science.\n\nHere are some of the most valuable lessons Iâ€™ve learned that no textbook or lecture could have fully prepared me for:\n\n\n### Real World Data\n\nIn nearly every data science class I've taken, my teachers have emphasized the importance of tidy data. \n\n<img src=\"tidy.png\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 250px;\">\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(mpg) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(cty, hwy), size = 4, alpha = 0.5) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 3 - Tabsets\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Transforming OLS estimates\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\npreds_lm %>% \n  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = correct)) +\n  geom_jitter(size = 4, alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(species)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('grey60', thematic::okabe_ito(3)[3])) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3000, 6000, 1000)) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = 'top', \n    panel.background = element_rect(color = 'black'),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Body mass (in g)',\n    y = 'Bill length (in mm)'\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Maximizing likelihood\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nglm.mod <- glm(sex ~ body_mass_g + bill_length_mm + species, family = binomial, data = dat)\n\npreds <- dat %>% \n  mutate(\n    prob.fit = glm.mod$fitted.values,\n    prediction = if_else(prob.fit > 0.5, 'male', 'female'),\n    correct = if_else(sex == prediction, 'correct', 'incorrect')\n  )\n\n\npreds %>% \n  ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = correct)) +\n  geom_jitter(size = 4, alpha = 0.6) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(species)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(3000, 6000, 1000)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('grey60', thematic::okabe_ito(3)[3])) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = 'top', \n    panel.background = element_rect(color = 'black'),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Body mass (in g)',\n    y = 'Bill length (in mm)'\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n#### 4 - Some math stuff\n\n$$\n\\int_0^1 f(x) \\ dx\n$$\n\n\n\n\n## 2 - Columns\n\n::: {layout=\"[[1,1]]\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngeom_density(\n  mapping = NULL,\n  data = NULL,\n  stat = \"density\",\n  position = \"identity\",\n  ...,\n  na.rm = FALSE,\n  orientation = NA,\n  show.legend = NA,\n  inherit.aes = TRUE,\n  outline.type = \"upper\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstat_density(\n  mapping = NULL,\n  data = NULL,\n  geom = \"area\",\n  position = \"stack\",\n  ...,\n  bw = \"nrd0\",\n  adjust = 1,\n  kernel = \"gaussian\",\n  n = 512,\n  trim = FALSE,\n  na.rm = FALSE,\n  orientation = NA,\n  show.legend = NA,\n  inherit.aes = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## 2 - Margin captions\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder::gapminder, mapping = aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +\n  stat_density(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bla bla bla.
