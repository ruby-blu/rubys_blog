And while that has certainly been the case in the data science field, it’s also introduced the danger of oversimplifying the data we are working with.\nJust as important as pretty visuals and tidy data is a deep understanding of the real people behind the numbers. Understanding the individuals represented in each dataset and the human lives that could be affected by your analyses is what really sets an ethical data scientist apart from the rest."

    "section": "The Why",
    "text": "The Why\nTaking time to humanize datasets, well, takes time! It requires flexing muscles and practicing skills that may feel a little rusty or nonexistent at first. So why bother? Wouldn’t it be so much easier to plug in the numbers and be done? There are countless reasons to slow down and understand the people behind the numbers, one of the most important being the ethical ramifications of not engaging in this process. Let’s look into some personal and real-world examples that illustrate some of the potential outcomes of taking your time to know the people vs. just running the numbers.\n\nThe Benefits\nI currently work as a student assistant in the BYU-Idaho Executive Office. As part of my job, I’ve recently had the opportunity to work closely with the president of the university in his efforts to increase donations to the university. Over the past year, the university has seen a 62% increase in said donations. What, you might ask, has led to this increase? While there are certainly many factors at play here, I have been overwhelmed by President Meredith’s ability and insistence on seeing the individuals behind the numbers.\n\nOn top of the typical crazy schedule of a university president, President Meredith makes time to call, write letters to, and visit with many of those individual donors. He knows them by name and makes a tremendous effort to create personal relationships with them. This is not something that he reserves solely for donors. He strives in all his interactions to see students, faculty, and staff as more than just numbers and statistics but as real people with real value.\nIn multiple meetings with the president concerning donations to the university, I have watched as he’s gone name-by-name through the data and learned all he can about each individual. While he loves data and makes data analysis a priority, he does not forget or take for granted the people behind each data point. And it has led to incredible results for this campus.\n\n\nThe Avoided Downfalls\nNow that we’ve discussed one potential benefit, let’s take a look at some of the problems that arise when people fail to take the individuals into consideration.\nOne popular example is the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) Recidivism Algorithm. This algorithm determines the likelihood of someone becoming a repeat offender, and is used to make informed decisions about things such as sentencing and parole. It was first developed in 1998, and has been used to assess over one million offenders. However, there has been a significant amount of controversy surrounding the ethics of this algorithm.\nA 2016 ProPublica investigation into this algorithm found an alarming amount of bias, specifically in regards to the race of the offender. The following chart included in their report shows the distribution of COMPAS decile scores (the likelihood of being a repeat offender). Each of the individuals represented in this data were analyzed with the COMPAS algorithm and had not been arrested for a new offense within two years.\n\nClearly, there is a shocking tendency for the algorithm to give black defendants a higher decile score. These charts specifically show us that these scores are just wrong. The worst part of all of this is that this algorithm is being used to determine sentence length, sentence severity, and possibility for parole. It is having a real impact on millions of families and individuals. And it’s not unique in its bias!\nThere are countless examples of this: algorithms that make decisions based on real data that has been impacted by decades of social prejudice and injustice. While the data scientist behind these algorithms may not be the problem, they can certainly be part of the solution. And so can you! Let’s dive a bit into what we can do to help in the humanization process."

    "section": "The How",
    "text": "The How\nSo, how do we ensure that we see the people behind the data? It starts with a shift in mindset—a conscious effort to prioritize people over mere numbers. Here are a few ways to begin integrating this perspective into your work:\n\nAsk the Right Questions\nBefore diving into an analysis, take a step back and ask: Who is represented in this data? Whose voices are missing? How was this data collected, and what biases might exist?\n\n\nGo Beyond the Numbers\nData can only tell part of the story. Whenever possible, seek out real experiences that bring depth and context to the figures you’re analyzing. If you’re working with healthcare data, take time to understand the realities of the patients behind the statistics. If you’re analyzing student performance, consider the challenges those students face beyond just their grades.\n\n\nThink About the Impact\nEvery data-driven decision has real consequences. Before publishing an analysis, take a moment to reflect on who benefits from your work, who might be harmed by it, and what steps you can take to ensure fairness and accuracy.\n\n\nBring Stories Into Your Work\nData is powerful, but stories are what move people. Whenever possible, pair your insights with real-world narratives that remind your audience of the human experiences behind the numbers. This not only enhances understanding but also encourages more ethical decision-making.\n\n\nRemember: Data Represents People!\nAt the end of the day, data science isn’t just about numbers—it’s about people. Every data point represents an individual with their own experiences, challenges, and aspirations. Keeping this in mind will help you approach your work with greater care, responsibility, and empathy."

Looking back, I’ve often asked myself what caused me to change my major five times and go through this unconventional path. The conclusion I’ve come to is that I was searching for my “flow.”\nThis Flow State is what makes people lose all sense of time, completely engaged in a task they truly love. It’s something I never thought I would find in a major or a job, but was the driving force behind all of the major decisions I’ve made in my college career. Hopefully, reflecting on my journey will help you in your path to discover what brings you that beautiful sense of total attention and enjoyment."

When I was accepted to both universities, I chose BYU without a second thought and excitedly declared my major as English education.\nFor the entirety of Fall Semester 2020, I could be found in the McKay library with my nose deep in book after book, studying my life away. And I loved it! English was fascinating, my teachers were brilliant, and I couldn’t wait to come back to all of it after serving a mission for my Church. For me, this was a state of flow. It was challenging but I thrived on rising up to the task.\nMuch to my dissapointment, however, during my mission I felt very strongly like I needed to transfer to BYU-Idaho. So, I left behind the flow, shopping malls, and my dream school and moved to snowy Rexburg, Idaho."

I also quickly learned that the pace in Rexburg was a bit slower than what I was used to coming from Provo. My English education classes lacked the depth of what I’d taken previously. I was stuck in boredom: a low challenge, medium skills zone. I desperately wanted out. In an attempt to increase the challenge, I dropped the education and changed to English.\n\nThis didn’t exactly work as hoped. As the semester progressed, I felt that I was learning more at my work than I was in the classroom. Work was challenging, engaging, and new. Classes were similar to the IB class I’d already taken and felt like more of a review than anything else. I was still trapped in the boredom zone.\nThe few classes I really enjoyed were the GE math courses I was taking. I remember talking to my brother, a mechanic engineer recently graduated from BYU, about some of the math classes he was in. As we talked about our shared passion for math, he asked me why on earth I was studying English when I loved math so much! That conversation really made me think. Less than a week later, I had changed my class schedule for the following semester and switched my major to applied math."

As I got close to graduation, started taking Junior- and Senior-level classes, and looked at the remaining graduation requirements, I quickly began to burn out.

I would spend 9 hour days deep in the numbers and was surprised to discover that the time passed more quickly that it ever had before. \nI felt a wonderful combination of high challenge and high skill that can only be described as flow! I realized with excitement that I could make this the focus of my studies and my job for the rest of my life. As I looked into the various analytical majors offered at BYUI, data science kept jumping out at me. And so I made the switch."

    "text": "Lessons Learned\nWhile my coursework gave me a solid foundation in data science concepts, working in a real-world environment introduced challenges and insights I never encountered in a classroom. From handling messy, real-world data to communicating insights with non-technical decision-makers, my student employment has given me a clearer picture of what it truly means to work in data science.\nHere are some of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned that no textbook or lecture could have fully prepared me for:\n\nReal World Data\nIn nearly every data science class I’ve taken, my teachers have emphasized the importance of tidy data. As a quick refresher, a tidy dataset follows three rules: each variable is stored in its own column, each observation is stored in one row, and each value is stored in its own cell.\n\nMany of my professors attempted to challenge us with untidy data sets and give us practice wrangling them into a tidy form. Even when we were given “untidy” data, it was fairly simple to convert it into a workable table.\nThe main source of data I work with in the Executive Office is automatically generated in a PowerBI report. I pull an Excel or a csv file for specific dates from that report to my computer and do all of my manipulation from there. At first glance, these reports are set up pretty well: each row is a donation to the university and each column stores a specific variable about that donation.\nThe more I’ve worked with the data and the further I’ve pushed it, the more flaws I’ve discovered. Not only are there many columns and cells that contain multiple valies, there are some painful discrepencies and little uniformity between donation records for the same individuals. The same people donate under slightly different names (John Doe vs John S. Doe), husbands are listed as the primary and wives as the affiliated donor for one donation and then they’re switched in the following, and sometimes people donate through large organizations and are hidden in a completely differnt column in the report.\nI love this image, as I feel it accurately represents how I’ve felt working with this data over the past two years."

    "text": "Introduction\nOne of my favorite things about going to college at Brigham Young University-Idaho is the emphasis on real-world experience. Courses and faculty aim to simulate this in a classroom through various project and hands-on experiences. Despite some amazing in-class lessons learned and knowledge gained, I have found that the most valuable experiences I’ve had in the data science realm came from working as a student on campus."

    "text": "Background\nAt the beginning of my very first semester here at BYU-Idaho, I was hired as a student office assistant in the Executive Office. At the time, the position was all about writing and editing, although I was exposed to some data manipulation and management.\nAs the years have progressed, however, I have been tasked with more and more data-related assignments and been given amazing opportunities to work closely with members of the university’s data team. Now, my primary role in the office is anything and everything data-related, including donations to the university and student scholarships."

    "text": "Lessons Learned\nWhile my coursework gave me a solid foundation in data science concepts, working in a real-world environment introduced challenges and insights I never encountered in a classroom. From handling messy, real-world data to communicating insights with non-technical decision-makers, my student employment has given me a clearer picture of what it truly means to work in data science.\n\nReal World Data\nIn nearly every data science class I’ve taken, my teachers emphasized the importance of tidy data: each variable in its own column, each observation in its own row, and each value in its own cell.\n\nMany of my professors attempted to challenge us with untidy data sets and give us practice wrangling them into a tidy form. Even when we were given “untidy” data, it was fairly simple to convert it into a workable table.\nThe main source of data I work with in the Executive Office is automatically generated in a PowerBI report. At first glance, these reports are set up pretty well: each row is a donation to the university and each column stores a specific variable about that donation.\nThe more I’ve worked with the data and the further I’ve pushed it, the more flaws I’ve discovered. Not only are there many columns and cells that contain multiple values, there are some painful discrepencies and little uniformity between donation records for the same individuals.\nI love this image, as I feel it accurately represents how I’ve felt working with this data over the past two years (I’m the purple fluffball, in case there was any confusion).\n\nSo, how can you get past this? How did I get past it? I’ve learned to accept that there are just some things I won’t be able to get perfect. With messy data like this, especially when it’s hundreds of thousands of rows long, you have to be okay with good enough. Now, that’s not by any means an excuse to be lazy or not produce good work. It just means that you must do everything in your power to overcome the mess, get the data in a useful (not perfect) form, and then get your report done and move on to the next thing.\nWhen you’re in a real-world environment, you often don’t have two weeks to mess with your data and take your time to reach perfection. That’s why it’s so important to be familiar with the data your company gives you and to know how to quickly become familiar with any new datasets. The executives asking for your analysis care much more about the practical application and steps you recommend than the specific numbers and data. Make sure to not let perfectionism get in the way of producing useful information.\n\n\nCommunicating Results\nIn your data science classes, every time you present or submit an assignment to a professor, you are talking to other data scientists. Honestly, the only reason they are looking at your report is to see whether it’s accurate: whether the code was written well and the visuals look presentable. If you’re like me, you go into the presentation thinking only about how they are going to judge the work you did. Because they know exactly how to do what you do, but they could do it way better!\nPresenting to non-technical executives in a work environment is completely different. Quite frankly, it’s a major shift that I am still getting used to. I remember the first time I presented a report to the president of the university. I was nervous. I rushed through the slides, only to be interrupted with questions about the data and findings. It was a wake-up call! I realized my audience wasn’t looking to critique the work, but rather to understand the insights and how they could be applied.\n\nAt the end of our meeting, he said something along the lines of how good information leads to better decision making. Unlike my professors, his goal in seeing my work wasn’t to judge me; he automatically trusted in the information I was presenting and wanted my insights into how to use it moving forward.\nThis was not something I had every experienced as a student before. It was humbling to have someone in a much higher position than myself automatically believe in the work I had done. It also opened my eyes to the importance of carefully reviewing my own work. When you don’t have people constantly looking over your shoulder, you have to solidify your own process for quality control."

From wrangling messy, real-world data to effectively communicating insights with decision-makers, I’ve learned that technical skills are only part of the equation. The ability to adapt, prioritize efficiency over perfection, and present findings in a clear, actionable way is just as crucial.\nThis experience has reinforced that data science isn’t just about numbers—it’s about solving problems and driving informed decisions. While my coursework provided the foundation, my student employment has shown me what it truly means to apply data science in a professional setting."
